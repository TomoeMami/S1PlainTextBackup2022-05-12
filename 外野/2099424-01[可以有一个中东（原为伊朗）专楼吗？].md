有啥用，有本书罢赛不代表伊朗队，要不就和美国队比赛时候打假球，再更点的万一拿到大力神杯 摔碎了也不带回伊朗，能做到吗不能，难道不唱国歌就不是代表伊朗比赛了？不过就是玩点小聪明罢了

以色列的极右翼又开始折腾性别隔离政策了

拉皮德愤然回应：以色列不是伊朗！

[https://www.haaretz.com/israel-n ... e-a1f6-93ff11ba0000](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2022-11-20/ty-article/.premium/israels-religious-and-far-right-parties-demand-law-to-legitimize-gender-segregation/00000184-93ff-d9ce-a1f6-93ff11ba0000)
 <blockquote>In exchange for joining the coalition, the far-right Religious Zionism and United Torah Judaism parties have demanded legislation that gender separation at public events will not be considered discrimination. Likud has not yet decided whether to grant the demand.

Prime Minister Yair Lapid said in response: “While in Iran courageous women are fighting for their rights, in Israel, Smotrich and the ultra-Orthodox nationalists are trying to send women behind barriers and enshrine into law separation between men and women. Where is Likud? Why are they silent? This is not Iran."

According to a report in Israel Hayom, Religious Zionism and UTJ want to legalize separation of men and women at ultra-Orthodox and Orthodox cultural events, education and public services. This will prevent what they call “judicial persecution by the legal system.”

Attempts have been made in recent years to normalize gender separation at Orthodox cultural events, campuses and other locales, which is currently illegal but has been allowed, under controversy, in certain circumstances.</blockquote>https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-722862
 <blockquote>United Torah Judaism and Religious Zionist Party demanded, as part of ongoing coalition negotiations, to legalize gender segregation for the ultra-Orthodox and religious public, a report said Sunday.

The demand is to enact legislation that says that segregation between men and women in public spaces, specifically cultural events for the haredi and religious public, academic studies and public services, would not be considered illegal discrimination, according to Israel Hayom.

Israeli law currently prohibits gender segregation in public services and spaces, except in specific circumstances that meet a number of requisite criteria.

Former attorney-general Avichai Mandelblit stipulated that this includes a provision that not segregating will bar a specific group from participating and a preference that the segregation be voluntary and planned as such.

The courts, in the past, blocked gender-segregated events based on these principles, the most notable being a concert by haredi singer Motti Steinmetz in Afula in 2019, which the High Court ruled unlawful just as the concert was ending.</blockquote><blockquote>The move by UTJ and RZP is aimed at stopping the “legal hounding” of any form of segregation, according to Israel Hayom. It is not intended to force segregation on the public but only for the haredi and religious populaces, the report added.

Prime Minister Yair Lapid responded on Twitter, “While brave women in Iran are fighting for their rights, in Israel, Smotrich and the haredi-religious are trying to relegate women behind barriers and legalize segregation between men and women. Where is the Likud? Why are they silent? This is not Iran,” Lapid wrote.</blockquote>

另外今天的以色列日常孤狼袭击，18人受伤

[https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-723133](https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-723133)
 <blockquote>Two explosions rocked the entrance to the city of Jerusalem on Wednesday morning near the Central Bus Station at the entrance to the neighborhood of Ramot, wounding at least 18 people. Two of the injured were in serious condition.

The causes of the explosions were not immediately determined but Israel Police said that the one near the Central Bus Station appeared to have been caused by a bomb placed in a bag near the bus. The bus was riddled with holes, showing the dispersion of shrapnel. Another explosion went off minutes later near the Ramot Intersection in northern Jerusalem.</blockquote>
