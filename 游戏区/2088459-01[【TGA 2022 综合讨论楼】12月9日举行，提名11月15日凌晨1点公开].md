杰夫：

40～50个游戏将参展（甚至可能会有小岛的新作）

我不想再承诺会有像12个Elden Ring之类的东西而惹上麻烦（艹，是去年的事吧<img src="https://static.saraba1st.com/image/smiley/face2017/068.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> ）

但我们感觉很好，这将是我们更强大的阵容。你可能会在展会上看到10+新作

This year’s show promises a new category for the awards (bumping the total to 31 with the inclusion of Best Adaptation), <strong>glimpses of 40 to 50 games (a handful of which will be brand-new teasers), and perhaps even a showing of game dev auteur Hideo Kojima’s latest project </strong>(He is, showrunner Geoff Keighley points out, a “dear friend of the show.”)

As is always the case in the run-up to the show, Keighley was a bit cagey about what exactly to expect from this year’s show. 

What he did say was that The Game Awards would probably have 40 to 50 games across the show – some reveals, some existing titles. 

“It’s a strong year for us, for new game announcements for sure,” he added. “I don’t want to get in trouble by promising, like, 12 Elden Rings or something, but we feel good. This will be one of our stronger line-ups. <strong>There are probably more than a dozen new things you’ll see at the show.</strong>”

小岛方面的询问：

And what about Hideo Kojima? Kojima has a long history of collaborating with Keighley on reveals, is on the show’s advisory board, and was not too long ago teasing his new creation.

“No updates on Hideo’s status,” Keighley said. “<strong>But he is obviously a dear friend of the show. I'm sure he will participate in some way. </strong>I think he's still figuring out his plans. So I'm sure in some way he will play a role. I think we're still trying to figure out what he exactly is going to do.”
